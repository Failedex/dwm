# dwm - yet another catppuccin build

this is my messy patch of dwm, but at least it kinda looks good (very subjective statement)

![cat dwm](https://github.com/Failedex/dwm/blob/master/dwmcatrice.png?raw=true)

## Installing
```
sudo make install
```

## patches
- actualfullscreen
- attachaside
- autostart (has autostart.sh)
- barpadding (is disabled in config)
- centered window name 
- cyclelayouts 
- launchers (buttons to launch anything)
- layoutmenu (click layout)
- pertag 
- preserveonrestart 
- rainbowtags 
- scratchpads
- statusallmons 
- statuspadding 
- swallow
- vanitygaps (with like, a ton of tiling options)
- winicon

By the way, Mod+Ctrl+Shift+1 plays freebird

## Dependencies:
- xmenu (for layout menu)
- sox (for it to play freebird)
- alacritty
- rofi
- nitrogen
- i3lock
- brightnessctl
- pactl
- playerctl

most of these are optional (as in, some feature just won't be there). Just edit the source code if you use something else
